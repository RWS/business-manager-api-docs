    "keywords": "Trados Business Manager API Documentation Introduction Trados Business Manager (TBM) allows you to use the API to manipulate its data. The API covers all the tables existing in the TBM database from reference data, to all documents. In general, using the API you can create, edit and delete any data contained in your TBM instance. Some functionalities may be missing in API (for example, retrieving a list of recommended vendors in a new translation assignment). We'll be extending the API capabilities by adding more endpoints with time. You can use the \"Improve this Doc\" feature on this page to submit a pull request with any suggested changes, and you can also use the RWS Community forums . Guide to using the Trados Business Manager API You can find a useful introduction to the TBM API in the RWS Community here: https://community.sdl.com/product-groups/translationproductivity/business-manager/w/wiki/5916/api Where to find the API Documentation The API has to be installed separately on your server as it is not delivered with the main TBM application. It's also only available with the Team and Enterprise editions of TBM from version 6 onwards. You'll find some information about how to install and configure the application in this wiki article in the RWS Community. Exploring the Swagger Interface You can explore the available endpoints using the Trados Business Manager API documentation available here: https://api.ibaccs.com Video Tutorial You can also find a useful video demonstrating how to use the TBM API capabilities to create custom tools for manipulating data stored in the TBM database:"
